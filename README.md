# Stockpile

***Project Documentation: [Available Here](https://github.com/michael-lundie/Capstone-Project/blob/master/Capstone_Stage1.pdf)*** 

##Purpose

This application is intended for users living in countries prone to natural disasters, who would like a convenient and motivational way to create and easily manage an emergency stockpile of supplies.

##Features

*Users can create a database of stockpiled food items.
*Track perishable items, receiving alerts to replace stock.
*Track total stocked calories and water volume.
*Lists are synced onto the cloud allowing for back-ups and sharing.
*Create shopping lists and receive monthly promts to buy items.
*Take pictures of stockpiled items, catalogued for easy retrieval/replacement.

##Important

This application makes use of Dagger 2 for dependency injection along with an MVVM view model. With the release of Hilt, Dagger 2 is obselete.

This application is in the process of being rewritten for Kotlin utilising Hilt and an alternative application architecture (a more traditional MVC model).
